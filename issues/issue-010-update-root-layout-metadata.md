# Issue 010: Update Root Layout Metadata

## Priority
**Low**

## Type
Cleanup

## Problem Statement

The root layout metadata in `frontend/app/layout.tsx` still shows the default Next.js placeholder text instead of actual application information.

**Current (placeholder):**
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};
```

This affects:
- Browser tab titles
- Search engine results
- Social media sharing previews

## User Story

**As a** user discovering or sharing the application
**I want** proper application metadata (title, description, Open Graph tags)
**So that** the app has correct branding and appears properly in search results and social media shares

## Affected Files

- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` (lines 55-57)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Update title to reflect actual application name
2. Update description to describe the application purpose
3. Add appropriate Open Graph metadata for social sharing

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. SEO-friendly title and description
2. Consistent with application branding

## Technical Approach

### 1. Update Metadata

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: {
    default: "Neo4j Communication Analytics",
    template: "%s | Neo4j Communication Analytics"
  },
  description: "Analyze communication patterns and relationships using Neo4j graph database. Visualize conversations, track user interactions, and gain insights into team communication dynamics.",
  keywords: ["neo4j", "communication", "analytics", "graph database", "conversations"],
  authors: [{ name: "Neo4j Communication Team" }],
  openGraph: {
    title: "Neo4j Communication Analytics",
    description: "Analyze communication patterns and relationships using Neo4j graph database.",
    type: "website",
  },
};
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Title displays "Neo4j Communication Analytics" in browser tab
- [ ] Description accurately describes the application
- [ ] Open Graph metadata is present for social sharing
- [ ] No regressions in page loading

## Test Plan

1. **Manual Verification:**
   - Load application and verify browser tab shows correct title
   - Inspect page source to verify meta tags
   - Test with social media preview tools (optional)

2. **Build Verification:**
   - Run `npm run build` to verify no errors
